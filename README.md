# Download Esign iOS - On Device iPA Signing Tool - iOS 14 - iOS 17.5.1

Esign iOS app is a tool used for signing iPA apps with Apple Developer/Distribution certificates and installing them.

Esign is a popular iPA sign tool that allows users to sign iPA files directly from their iPhone or iPad. To sign iPA files using this app, you must have an Apple Developer or a globally available Distribute certificate. The Esign iOS utility was supported from iOS 14 to the most recent iOS version, iOS 17.4. 
To sign an iPA file, users must import and set the p12 and .mobileconfiguration files. 

The key advantage of Esign is its time-saving nature. Users can sign iPA files without the need for a PC, a feature that promotes efficiency. Additionally, with your developer certificate, there's no need to resign iPA files to avoid 7-day app revocation, providing a sense of relief.

## Why do we need the Esign iOS APP?

The modern tech world is evolving rapidly, with new app developers constantly introducing innovative concepts as apps. While some of these apps can be found in the official Apple app store, many developers are opting to release their useful iPhone apps through third-party stores or on a GitHub iPA Library. To access these apps, iPhone owners can use the Esign iOS App, a tool that allows for the installation of third-party programs outside of the Apple App Store. 

You could use the Esign iOS App to install third-party applications. The team at yyyue.xyz created this device signing tool. 

This tool supports all iPhone models, the most recent iOS version, and free Esign certificates available globally. You can use these free certificates to sign and install iPA files on your device. 

Unlike AltStore, Sideloadly limitations, this tool will change the game by allowing iOS users to sign iPA files directly; neither user needs developer knowledge. 
The best part is that you don't need a jailbroken iPhone or iPad. This tool can be used with or without Jailbreak. 

To sign and install the IPA file on your iDevice, Esign requires a .p12 certificate. As mentioned, you can use the globally available free certificate by following the link. However, those certificates are likely to be revoked quickly due to Apple's new cert revoke mechanism. Once Apple revokes the certificate, your installed iPA apps also get revoked, which means you need to resign them with a new free certificate. 

We strongly advise you to buy high-quality certificates from legitimate certificate-selling services. 
Here are some of them:

[u04s.com](https://u04s.com)

Once you have premium .p12 and .mobileprovision files, the apps will not get revoked and will work for a long time.

You must usually use PC signing methods like Sideloadly, AltStore, and TrollStore tools to install the Esign app. But with the help of the EsignPatch app, you can install the Esign app without a PC.
