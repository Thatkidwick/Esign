# Esign iOS - On Device iPA Signing Tool - iOS 14 - iOS 17.4.1

Esign is a tool used for signing iPA apps with Apple Developer/Distribution certificates and installing them.

Esign is a popular iPA signature tool that allows users to sign iPA files directly from their iPhone or iPad. To sign iPA files using this app, you must have an Apple Developer or a globally available Distribute certificate. The Esign iOS utility was supported from iOS 14 to the most recent iOS version, iOS 17.4. 
To sign an iPA file, users must import and set the p12 and .mobileconfiguration files. 

The key advantage of Esign is its time-saving nature. Users can sign iPA files without the need for a PC, a feature that promotes efficiency. Additionally, with your own developer certificate, there's no need to resign iPA files to avoid 7-day app revocation, providing a sense of relief.
